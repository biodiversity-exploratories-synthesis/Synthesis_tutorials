# Synthesis_tutorials
A collection of tutorials generated during the statistical help-desk, courses and research projects. When browsing through the tutorials on GitHub, we recommend clicking on the ".md" documents, which appear nicely online. When working with the tutorial, we recommend using the ".Rmd" versions which can easily be manipulated in RStudio.

There are further tutorials in [our R buddy course folders](https://github.com/allanecology/R-buddies-course).
